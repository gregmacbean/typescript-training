# Typescript Familiarity Assessment

The Typescript Familiarity Assessment goal is to provide you with a set of questions to assess the Typescript knowledge of your team/crew.

:warning: Typescript Familiarity Assessment __does not__ intend to be a Maturity Model, and it should not be used as such.

Instead, we expect to help organizations identify Typescript knowledge gaps and use the results to prepare learnings, training, or similar to fill those gaps.
